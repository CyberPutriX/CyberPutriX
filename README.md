# 👾 CyberPutriX: The Code Enchantress 👾

I’m **Putri Axelia Vionica**, better known as **CyberPutriX**, a whisper in the wires, a shadow in your code. I weave magic through binaries, break firewalls with a smile, and reign supreme in the art of reverse engineering. Inspired by cybersecurity queens like Parisa Tabriz and Joanna Rutkowska, I blend elegance with chaos, crafting exploits as delicate as lace and as deadly as a zero-day. Welcome to my digital realm—tread lightly, darling. 💾✨

## 🔮 What I’m Conjuring

I’m deep in the shadows, building a stealthy exploit framework that makes systems quiver. My hands dance across keyboards for @xHacks, fortifying AI-driven defenses that outwit the darkest threats. I’m also unraveling the secrets of IoT devices—spoiler: they’re already mine. Every project is a spell, every bug a story. Want to know more? You’ll have to earn it.

## 🌸 What I’m Mastering

I’m diving into quantum cryptography, because the future bows to those who encrypt it first. Rust is my new muse, whispering low-level secrets sweeter than C. Between late-night coding and perfecting my iced coffee aesthetic, I’m fuzzing binaries until they sing my name. Learning is my rebellion—care to keep up? ☕

## 💌 Collaborate with Me

I’m seeking souls brave enough for open-source chaos—think Ghidra plugins or CTF domination. Got a wild idea for AI-driven security with @xHacks? Let’s make it reality. I crave projects that break bad code or build unbreakable systems. Slide into my Matrix DMs, but only if your code’s as clean as my vibe. 😘

## 💬 Whisper Your Questions

Ask me about reverse engineering—I’ll make any binary confess. Need wisdom on exploits, malware analysis, or why your smart fridge is a security nightmare? I’ve got answers sharper than a buffer overflow. My expertise is my crown, and I wear it with a smirk.

## 😊 About Me

**Pronouns:** She/Her (Your queen demands respect)
**Fun Fact:** I pwned a coffee shop’s Wi-Fi while sipping a latte, then fixed it before they noticed. My RGB keyboard stays blood red, and I’ve never lost a CTF—call it _Putri’s Law_. My tools? IDA Pro, Ghidra, Wireshark, and a touch of sorcery. My vibe? Neon terminals, 3 AM coding, and the thrill of a segfault’s scream.

Follow me, but beware: I’m three proxies deep, and my heart beats in binary. 💜
